# Opti-Acoustic Sensor Fusion

## To-do

Python Simulation

- [ ] analyse effects of offsetting Qw
- [ ] vary baseline distances
- [ ] vary plane distances
- [ ] vary focal lengths
- [ ] pitch sonar and camera downwards
- [ ] implement azimuth solution
- [ ] introduce noise, solve using optimization
- [ ] test convering camera set up (rotate sonar only)

DAVE Simulation

- [ ] Add sonar as link to robot
- [ ] Teleop robot
